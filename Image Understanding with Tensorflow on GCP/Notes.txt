Introduction


Linear and DNN models
The ideal decision boundary of cat vs non cat is defined by the relationship between pixels. 

Convolutional Neural Networks

The Larger the size of the kernel, the smaller the output of the convolution layers

Add smaller filters while adding more convolutional layers. Strides of a kernel is usually set to 
smaller than the size of the kernels. 

Dealing with Data Scarcity

For a Linear Model, the number of parameters is: Height * Width * NClasses + NCLASSES

Common Image Augmentation Techniques:
    - Blur
    - Resize
    - Sharpen
    - Crop
    - Flip
    - Rotate
    - Change Hue, Brightness or Contrast

For Transfer Learning:
    - Cut the layers at the output. 
    - If dataset is small, then do not update the weight of the network, else update the weights
    of the original network.
