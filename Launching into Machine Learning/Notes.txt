Attributes related to Data Quality includes:
    - Accuracy of Data
    - Consistency of Data
    - Timeliness of Data
    - Completeness of Data

Ways to Improve Data Quality:
    - Resolve Missing values
    - Convert the Date Feature Column to Datetime Format
    - Parse date/time features
    - Remove unwanted values
    - Convert Categorical Columns to "one-hot encodings"


For Regression Problems, the loss function is the mean squared error. The goal is to reduce the 
loss as much as possible, so we need to find a way to minimize the loss with respect to the weights. 

We can visualize a Decision Tree Graph, through he following commands:

# Here we are importing some built-in visualization functionalities for decision trees
from IPython.display import Image  
from sklearn.externals.six import StringIO  
from sklearn.tree import export_graphviz
import pydot 

dot_data = StringIO()  
export_graphviz(decision_tree=dtree, out_file=dot_data,feature_names=features,filled=True,rounded=True)

graph = pydot.graph_from_dot_data(s=dot_data.getvalue())  
Image(graph[0].create_png())  

A Parameter of an ML Model, is changed during model training, 
while Hyper-parameters are set before training. 

A typical loss curve follows a big drop in loss metrics early on (big steps) 
while many smaller steps as we get closer to a minima. 

Model Training Involves the following Steps:
    - Calculate Derivative
    - Take a Step
    - Check loss

Training on the full dataset every step is expensive. Minibatching reduces cost while preserving quality. 

Performance Metrics and Loss Functions:
    Loss Functions:
        - It is evaluated during training times 
        - It is Harder to Understand
        - It is indirectly connected to Business Goals 
    Performance Metrics: 
        - It is evaluated after training
        - It is easier to Understand
        - Directly connected to Business Goals
